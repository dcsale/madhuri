# Installing Houdini Apprentice

Go to [www.sidefx.com/apprentice/][] and click on the "Download Apprentice" option from the free-edition column.  

For Ubuntu Linux, this gave me a tar.gz file I extracted to the temp directory.  Inside was an install script called "houdini.install" as root.  

    sudo ./houdini.install

This will take you through the install process.  Be sure to include the "Apprentice Licensing" option instead of "Commercial License Server".  After going through the rest of the default options, this installed Houdini in /opt/hfs12.1.230.  

I had some errors getting Houdini to run after that, but I'm tracking that in the [sidefx forums](http://www.sidefx.com/index.php?option=com_forum&Itemid=172&page=viewtopic&p=129307#129307).
